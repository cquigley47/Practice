# Practice
Practing using GIt Desktop

This file was created automatically when the repo was created on Github.
Now I am making changes. To save changes they have to be Committed. 
When you Commit you tell it which branch. Below is quote from the GIT Help

      decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. 
      If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit
      and then create a pull request. 
      
So I will create a new branch but not sure why.

This is the second change. The new branch was so the "owner" of the project could decide if my 
changes should be added. When only one person is working on a small project probably not important
unless want to be able to go back to an older version.

This is the third change. I installed Git Desktop and it opened with ProgrammingAssignment2 and Other datasciencecoursera. PA2 has cachematrix.R. the other says no local changes. It looks like cachematrix.R is same on GitHUb. When I 'explored' the second one it brought me to local folder Chuck\reponame which has a .git folder with other stuff. When I changed the PA view to Changes it also said no local changes and exploring brought me another local folder.

BUt why are these the only 2 repos shown in GitDesktop??? So I am going to try to Clone the PRactice repo.

And Cloning was easy. I let if create the local repo under github. 

Now lets try syncing this change on Github to local. #### - That worked great using the Sync Button.

So how to make a change locally and push it up?

	Created new branch on desktop. Switched to the branch and it has the empty, do you want to explore.
	I took a chance and am editing the local file directly. PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA!

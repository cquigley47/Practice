# Practice
Practing using GIt Desktop

This file was created automatically when the repo was created on Github.
Now I am making changes. To save changes they have to be Committed. 
When you Commit you tell it which branch. Below is quote from the GIT Help

      decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. 
      If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit
      and then create a pull request. 
      
So I will create a new branch but not sure why.
